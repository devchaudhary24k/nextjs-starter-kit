---

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [ ] Animate verify email page icon
- [ ] Create a global theme for both light and dark mode
- [ ] Add proper documentation of how to add or remove features
- [ ] Add comments in every file for every function and every call
- [ ] Minimize Database requests and session request as low as possible
- [ ] Also add documentation on how to remove a certain feature from the app
